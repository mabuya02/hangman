# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

A graphical Hangman game built using Python and Tkinter. In this game, you try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win; if they run out of attempts, they lose.

## Features
- Classic Hangman gameplay with a modern UI
- Visual representation of the hangman as wrong guesses are made
- Keyboard shortcuts: 
  - Press `Enter` to guess a letter
  - Press `R` to reset the game
- Randomly generated words from a predefined list
- Winning celebration with visual effects





## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
   cd hangman-game
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

## How to Play
1. When the game starts, a random word is chosen and displayed as underscores (_).
2. Enter a letter in the input box and click "Guess" (or press `Enter`).
3. If the letter is part of the word, it will appear in the correct position(s).
4. If the letter is not part of the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. You have 6 wrong attempts. After that, the game ends and the word is revealed.
6. You win if you guess the word before running out of attempts.

### Controls
- **Guess a letter**: Type a letter and press `Enter` or click "Guess".
- **Reset game**: Press `R` or click "Reset Game".
